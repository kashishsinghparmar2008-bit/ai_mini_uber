# 🚖 AI-Powered Mini Uber

An **AI-powered ride-sharing simulation** built for hackathons, combining  
**Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** with **intelligent decision-making**.

---

## 📌 Overview
This project simulates a simplified Uber-like system where:
- A city is represented as a **graph**
- The **shortest route** is calculated using **Dijkstra’s Algorithm**
- The **nearest driver** is intelligently assigned
- The **ride fare** is dynamically predicted using AI-inspired logic

The backend is **fully deployed and live**, with a simple frontend interface.

## ✨ Features

### 🚗 Ride & Routing
- Shortest path calculation using **Dijkstra’s Algorithm**
- Pickup to drop route generation
- Path printing (e.g., A → B → D)

### 👤 Driver Assignment
- Nearest driver selection
- Rule-based **AI driver scoring**

### 🧠 AI-Based Fare Prediction
- Base fare + distance-based pricing
- **Traffic-aware pricing** (LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH)
- **Time-based surge pricing** (peak hours)
- Dynamic fare calculation (Uber-like behavior)

### 🌐 Frontend
- Simple UI with “Book Ride” button
- Displays driver, route, distance, and fare

### 🚀 Deployment
- Backend deployed live using **Render**
- Public API endpoint available
